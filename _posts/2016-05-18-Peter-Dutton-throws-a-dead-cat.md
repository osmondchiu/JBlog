This morning I awoke to furore about <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/18/dutton-slammed-over-illiterate-and-innumerate-refugees-comments">comments that Immigration Minister Peter Dutton made on Sky News last night.</a> He claimed that if Australia’s refugee intake was dramatically increased (as proposed by Labor and the Greens), “illiterate” refugees would come to Australia, take jobs and drive up unemployment.

Social media was ablaze with people attacking Dutton for making such a suggestion, accusing him of racism and rebutting his claims about refugees with facts. Some even suggested it was a gaffe. It was not. It was intentional.

What Dutton did was <a href="http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2015/04/is-the-tory-trident-row-an-example-of-a-dead-cat-strategy/">“throw a dead cat on the table.”</a>  It is a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/lynton-crosby-and-dead-cat-won-election-conservatives-labour-intellectually-lazy">signature election manoeuvre by Lynton Crosby,</a> used to regain control of public debate. Media attention switches as everyone reacts to whatever outrageous and offensive statement is made. Everyone will be talking about what you want them to talk about (in this case, refugees). <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-julie-bishop-backs-peter-dutton-on-illiterate-asylum-seekers-20160517-goxjd6.html">Julie Bishop’s tacit agreement with Dutton</a> affirms that this is no gaffe, it is an intentional strategy. It is aimed at distracting everyone and keeping the focus on refugees. It is a tactic that is succeeding.

The <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/lynton-crosby-and-dead-cat-won-election-conservatives-labour-intellectually-lazy">Tories used the "dead cat" to great effect in the last British election</a> and locally George Christensen and Cory Bernardi are particularly adept at this tactic. People dismiss them as idiots because of the views they espouse publicly but they know exactly what they are doing. Their incendiary statements are about grabbing maximum public attention and trying to force a response on their issues.

Those who oppose the Coalition need to stop taking the bait. The Coalition does not want the election to be focused on education, Medicare or housing affordability which are <a href="http://www.essentialvision.com.au/most-important-election-issues-3">far more important issues</a> to voters and <a href="http://www.essentialvision.com.au/party-trust-to-handle-issues-9">Labor’s strengths</a>. Instead it wants it to be focused on refugees and national security because they see them as electorate winners. Labor does not win votes talking about either. They either lose votes to the Coalition or the Greens.

It won’t be the last time that the Coalition tries this tactic during this election but progressives need to far get better at responding and shifting the focus away whenever a “dead cat” is thrown.
