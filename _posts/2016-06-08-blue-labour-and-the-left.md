<a href="http://www.nextleft.org/2011/07/so-what-is-blue-labour.html">Blue Labour</a> has a bad reputation in left-wing circles. Many perceive it to be racist, conservative, patriarchal and anti-state, summed up with the view that it is about "<a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2011/04/labour-party-english-england">flag, faith and family"</a>. While there has been widespread criticism of Blue Labour by many sections of the British <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2011/aug/01/diane-abbott-blue-labour-video">Labour</a> <a href="http://www.leftfutures.org/2011/04/blue-labour-no-thanks/">left</a>, concern not only exists in Britain. For example, I helped organise a <a href="http://nsw-fabians.madewithopinion.com/blue-labour-and-the-politics-of-the-common-good/#autoplay">Fabian Society event with Maurice Glasman</a>, a key figure in Blue Labour, in Sydney and got the NSW Left to promote. There was some criticism that we should not be promoting such an event.

Understandably a lot of the hesitation comes from what people think of Glasman on issues of national identity and a perception that Blue Labour is about social conservatism. The framing of Blue Labour as a "radical conservative" tradition has not helped win fans on the broader Left. Many are uncomfortable with what he has said about immigration and nationalism in particular, dislike of how he framed the middle-class Fabian and working-class traditions of the political wing of the labour movement in highly gendered terms.

But to dismiss everything Glasman and Blue Labour has said is wrong and foolish. There is a lot from Blue Labour's analysis to draw on and much of it is already in common use. For example, the idea of community organising and building a relational approach has already taken hold in parts of the Left here, most notably through the Sydney Alliance. Glasman has been<a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/alan-finlayson/should-left-go-blue-making-sense-of-maurice-glasman"> heavily involved with London Citizens</a>, the London counterpart to Sydney Alliance. Similarly, focusing on the common good is nothing new with Australian academic <a href="http://www.davidmcknight.com.au/archives/2005/09/beyond-right-and-left-introduction">David McKnight talking about similar issues and using the same language nearly a decade ago.</a>

Blue Labour's focus on importance of relationships, place and work also has much to offer. They are all fundamental to personal identity and anchor our lives. Maurice Glasman has also championed ideas of mutuality, reciprocity, solidarity and community ownership, all drawn from important Left traditions that some argue has been lost.

Many in Left may feel uncomfortable with Glasman's suggestion that it should ditch talk about equality. It is not because Glasman is opposed to equality but rather he argues for most people it is an abstract concept rather than being grounded in everyday life and common sense. This everyday politics and common sense has more in common with those associated with Stuart Hall and Marxism Today than the conservative Right.

<a href="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/confronting-the-city/">Blue Labour also draws on Karl Polanyi</a>, who arguably should be to social democrats what Hayek is to the free market Right, particularly his concerns about commodification. It is most powerful because its language about commodification is something that much of the Left has lost. <a href="http://insidestory.org.au/hearts-heads-and-pockets/">It is the 'moral critique of capitalism' that historian Frank Bongiorno argues Labor has lost.</a> The resistance to the dehumanising effect of the commodification of labour is a fundamental part of organised labour. That is the element of conservatism within the Left, resistance to the radical nature of free market liberalism. The Left has always sought to decommodify education, health care through guaranteeing universalism and rejecting basing value on economic benefits of decisions and actions.

In many ways aspects of Blue Labour could serve as a powerful and useful critique of the politics of the Hawke-Keating era and its top down, elitist and market driven politics. <a href="https://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/nick-dyrenfurth/2015/26/2015/1427332969/even-laborites-get-blues">Nostalgia for those politics still runs deep</a> despite it being the source of many of the ALP's current problems.

While there is much from Blue Labour that is of use, there are many aspects I disagree with, most notably <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/19/blue-labour-immigration">immigration and nationalism</a>. Even supporters have acknowledged its shortcomings in Australia. For example, <a href="https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=184523671754201&amp;id=184522121754356">Nick Dyrenfurth</a> has said this on immigration.

There are also questions about Blue Labour's vision for the role of the state and communities. <a href="http://www.fabians.org.uk/the-hugo-young-lecture-why-teachers-and-doctors-know-better/">David Walker has rightly pointed out</a> that while there is a focus on power, the two unanswered questions are: who pays? and what about professional skill? What happens when the community and those with expertise disagree? Windfarms and floridation are two immediate examples that come to mind. It is also unclear about who gets to define what the 'common good' is and how. It reinforces my belief that while Blue Labour has a strong critique but it does not offer a lot of good solutions.

I am also wary of Glasman's idolisation of Germany. <a href="http://www.ippr.org/juncture/ending-the-creditors-paradise-a-german-social-democrats-duty">Mark Blyth has highlighted that the German economic miracle is far from one.</a> It has relied on freezes in real wages, an increased labour force from the intergration of East Germany and the impact of the Euro making German exports more competitive. The German social market economy was designed afer the Second World War in response to the perceived threat of socialism. Its basis, ordo-liberalism, seeks a competitive enterprise economy.

Furthermore, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2013-04-03/austerity-delusion">he points out</a> that not every country can be a Germany and run a surplus, some need to run deficits, just as for someone to save, someone else needs to spend. This idealisation of Germany risks generalising ideas, policies and institutions that cannot be generalised.

Blue Labour also seemingly has little to say about the challenges we face. It is unclear what it has to say about the impact of technology and how it is transforming the economy and society. Can technology aid its vision of strengthening relationships and a sense of place or is it disruptive? What are its implications of technology for the future of work and what does that mean for its vision? Then there's challenges across the Western world such as climate change and an ageing population, let alone how to grapple with the waves of mass migration caused by conflict (and soon climate change).

If a Blue Labour approach was to be adopted in Australia, it is unlikely it would look the same as its counterpart in Britain. <a href="http://apo.org.au/resource/blue-labour-lessons-australia">The historian Frank Bongiorno has argued that we had our own version Blue Labour through Mark Latham</a>. I'm not sure given Latham's tendency towards neoliberalism, albeit tinged with working-class nostalgia and contempt for anything associated with the New Left.

Whatever the future holds for Blue Labour, there are aspects of it that the Left can draw on. The Left should embrace its moral critique of capitalism which much of the social democratic Left has lost. Rejecting abstract notions and a focus on the everyday (place, relationships, work) to reconnect with people are also important. However, for all that it can offer, Blue Labour does not provide any answers to the bigger challenges we face in the 21st century and it is trapped by its own romanticism and idealisation.
